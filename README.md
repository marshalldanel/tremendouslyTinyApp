# Tremendously Tiny URL Shortener

This app is a full stack web application built with Node and Express. It allows users to input a full length URL and makes it both tiny and great again.

## Getting Started

Find an enormous URL that you would like to shorten. Type it in the box. Hit enter. Poof! Copy and past your tremendously small URL.
Enjoy your url and your day.
